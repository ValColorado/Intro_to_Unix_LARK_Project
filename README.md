Name of game: Olive Quest

Developed by: Valentina Colorado

Olive is Lakeland's newest friendly neighborhood cat. She got a little confused after a long night out at Molly McMeow's Irish Pub and now needs help finding her way back.
Stop by some of Lakeland's well know establishments to see if you can find Olive's human (Valentina) to help Olive get back home.
Use basic Linux commands to navigate around. As you're wandering around town be on the lookout for lakeland's watch dog Toast. If he catches you he'll take Olive to the pound.....


```The purpose of this game is to learn basic linux commands as you (Olive) wander through Lakeland.```
